📈 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior for a telecom company and developing a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn. By leveraging historical customer data, we aim to uncover key patterns and factors influencing customer attrition, ultimately helping the business take proactive retention actions.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about 7,043 customers, with the following features:

Demographics: gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

Account Info: tenure, Contract, PaymentMethod, PaperlessBilling

Services Signed Up: PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies

Financial Data: MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges

Target Variable: Churn (whether the customer left or not)

🔧 Project Workflow
Data Exploration & Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent values in TotalCharges.

Converted data types as necessary.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to understand data distribution, correlations, and feature relationships with churn.

Feature Engineering

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding.

Scaled numerical features where required.

Model Development

Built multiple classification models including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated models on:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Analyzed feature importance to interpret business drivers of churn.

💻 Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, XGBoost)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub for version control

🔑 Key Insights
Contract Type, tenure, TechSupport, and MonthlyCharges emerged as major drivers of churn.

Customers on month-to-month contracts, with higher monthly charges, and no technical support showed significantly higher churn rates.

The best performing model achieved XX% ROC-AUC (you can update after your model evaluation).

🚀 Future Scope
Deploy model as a real-time prediction API.

Build interactive dashboards to monitor churn trends.

Incorporate customer support interaction data for better predictions.
